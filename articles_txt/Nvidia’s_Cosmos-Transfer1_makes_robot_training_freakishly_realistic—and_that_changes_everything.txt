Nvidia has released Cosmos-Transfer1, an innovative AI model that enables developers to create highly realistic simulations for training robots and autonomous vehicles. Available now on Hugging Face, the model addresses a persistent challenge in physical AI development: bridging the gap between simulated training environments and real-world applications.
“We introduce Cosmos-Transfer1, a conditional world generation model that can generate world simulations based on multiple spatial control inputs of various modalities such as segmentation, depth, and edge,” Nvidia researchers state in a paper published alongside the release. “This enables highly controllable world generation and finds use in various world-to-world transfer use cases, including Sim2Real.”

Unlike previous simulation models, Cosmos-Transfer1 introduces an adaptive multimodal control system that allows developers to weight different visual inputs—such as depth information or object boundaries—differently across various scene parts. This breakthrough enables more nuanced control over generated environments, significantly improving their realism and utility.
How adaptive multimodal control transforms AI simulation technology
Traditional approaches to training physical AI systems involve either collecting massive amounts of real-world data — a costly and time-consuming process — or using simulated environments that often lack the complexity and variability of the real world.
Cosmos-Transfer1 addresses this dilemma by allowing developers to use multimodal inputs (like blurred visuals, edge detection, depth maps, and segmentation) to generate photorealistic simulations that preserve crucial aspects of the original scene while adding natural variations.
“In the design, the spatial conditional scheme is adaptive and customizable,” the researchers explain. “It allows weighting different conditional inputs differently at different spatial locations.”
This capability proves particularly valuable in robotics, where a developer might want to maintain precise control over how a robotic arm appears and moves while allowing more creative freedom in generating diverse background environments. For autonomous vehicles, it enables the preservation of road layout and traffic patterns while varying weather conditions, lighting or urban settings.

Ming-Yu Liu, one of the core contributors to the project, explained why this technology matters for industry applications.
“A policy model guides a physical AI system’s behavior, ensuring that the system operates with safety and in accordance with its goals,” Liu and his colleagues note in the paper. “Cosmos-Transfer1 can be post-trained into policy models to generate actions, saving the cost, time, and data needs of manual policy training.”

The technology has already demonstrated its value in robotics simulation testing. When using Cosmos-Transfer1 to enhance simulated robotics data, Nvidia researchers found the model significantly improves photorealism by “adding more scene details and complex shading and natural illumination” while preserving the physical dynamics of robot movement.
For autonomous vehicle development, the model enables developers to “maximize the utility of real-world edge cases,” helping vehicles learn to handle rare but critical situations without needing to encounter them on actual roads.
Inside Nvidia’s strategic AI ecosystem for physical world applications
Cosmos-Transfer1 represents just one component of Nvidia’s broader Cosmos platform, a suite of world foundation models (WFMs) designed specifically for physical AI development. The platform includes Cosmos-Predict1 for general-purpose world generation and Cosmos-Reason1 for physical common sense reasoning.
“Nvidia Cosmos is a developer-first world foundation model platform designed to help Physical AI developers build their Physical AI systems better and faster,” the company states on its GitHub repository. The platform includes pre-trained models under the Nvidia Open Model License and training scripts under the Apache 2 License.
This positions Nvidia to capitalize on the growing market for AI tools that can accelerate autonomous system development, particularly as industries from manufacturing to transportation invest heavily in robotics and autonomous technology.
Real-time generation: How Nvidia’s hardware powers next-gen AI simulation
Nvidia also demonstrated Cosmos-Transfer1 running in real-time on its latest hardware. “We further demonstrate an inference scaling strategy to achieve real-time world generation with an Nvidia GB200 NVL72 rack,” the researchers note.
The team achieved approximately 40x speedup when scaling from one to 64 GPUs, enabling the generation of 5 seconds of high-quality video in just 4.2 seconds — effectively real-time throughput.
This performance at scale addresses another critical industry challenge: simulation speed. Fast, realistic simulation enables more rapid testing and iteration cycles, accelerating the development of autonomous systems.
Open-source Innovation: Democratizing Advanced AI for Developers Worldwide
Nvidia’s decision to publish both the Cosmos-Transfer1 model and its underlying code on GitHub removes barriers for developers worldwide. This public release gives smaller teams and independent researchers access to simulation technology that previously required substantial resources.
The move fits into Nvidia’s broader strategy of building robust developer communities around its hardware and software offerings. By putting these tools in more hands, the company expands its influence while potentially accelerating progress in physical AI development.
For robotics and autonomous vehicle engineers, these newly available tools could shorten development cycles through more efficient training environments. The practical impact may be felt first in testing phases, where developers can expose systems to a wider range of scenarios before real-world deployment.
While open source makes the technology available, putting it to effective use still requires expertise and computational resources — a reminder that in AI development, the code itself is just the beginning of the story.
